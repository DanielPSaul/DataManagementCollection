**Software & Languages:** Python, Jupyter Notebook

**Packages:** numpy, pandas, altair, networkx, requests

**Description:** This repository holds a collection of multiple group assignments that were not large enough for their own repository I completed for a Advanced Data Management and Analytics course at UGA. Each one becomes more advanced as the course went on, using sample datasets to answer specfic questions given by our professor that ultimately rely on each other to solve. Each assignment also addresses different chunks of concepts we were learning in the course.
